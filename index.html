  <b>HTML markup</b> <br>
HTML markup is made up of things called tags it looks something like Name <name> contents </name>mame the first thing is the opening tag the last thing is the closing tag and the all thing can be referred to as an element. 
To make something bold you make an opening B <b> the word </b> and a closing B
Another one is the EM tag – emphasis – italics to do this you make EM <em> the word </em>and the closing EM and the word between them is italicized. If you don’t put the end tag them everything after the EM <em> is italicized.</em><p>
<b>HTML attributes</b><br>
You still have the tag <tag attr= “value”> contents </tag>. The attributes always = the value.
Anchor - <a> a full example of this is <a href= www.rebbit.com> derp </a> HREF is the attribute name the web address is the value derp is the word that will become a link and if you click on this then it will open that web page in a new link. </p>
<b>Images</b><br>
To put in an image you write <IMG SRC= “URL” alt =text> SRC stands for source for the image URL is where the picture should come from alt stands for alternate if the picture is unavailable that the text should come up instead. It does not have a closing tag. So an example of how it would look like in the browser is <img src=http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png halt=hipmunk!”>.  And if you have text before or after the image the image will come up in the middle of the text.<br>
<b>Wight space</b><br>
The only way to make a sentence come up as two lines is to put in either BR <BR> tag which makes a brake or to put in a P <p> </p> tag which stands for paragraph by the P <p> tag there is a double space between the words. For example “this text if really too long for one line.” You would put either a BR <br> tag after really or a P <p></p> tag around both parts of the sentence. A BR <br> tag doesn’t need a closing tag. If you don’t put one of these tags then on the coding side you can put as many spaces or pres enter as many times as you want the computer will only see it as one space and no enters. The reason there is two ways to make two lines is b/c the BR <br> tag says that the line ends here and a new line starts after its called inline the P <p> tag is called a block tag which means that by a P <p></p> tag there is an invisible box around the word. An inline element are anything that has to do with what’s on that line like the <br> <b> <em> <img> all these tags are inline tags.</b></em> Another aliment is span/div <span> text </span> is inline and <div> text </div> is a block attribute and to these two you can add stiles to your document. A span element does not make it into two lines but a div aliment does.<br>
<b>HTML document</b><br>
A full HTML document starts on HTML 5 with doctype HTML tag <doctype HTML> what type of HTML document it is. Then an opening HTML tag HTML <html> and at the end of the document a closing HTML tag </html> this surrounds the rest of the document. Then you have head title tags <head> <title> title! </title> </head> this is the head of the document it has all sort of random data like stiles. Then you have the body text the body of the document <body> <b> content </b> </body>, which is what we had been learning about till now and will be learning about mostly in this course, followed by the closing tag of HTML </html>.
